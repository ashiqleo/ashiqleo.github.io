I’m **Ashiq PP**, an Urban Ecology researcher at the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), India and Research consultant at International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Hyderabad.

My work focuses on how cities and agricultural landscapes shape biodiversity, particularly **birds, invertebrates, and their ecological interactions**. I explore how urban planning, agricultural practices, and air pollution influence species diversity, abundance, and community structure.  

### 🔬 **Research Areas**
- **Urban Bird Ecology** – Understanding how cities provide resources for certain bird species while others avoid urban areas.  
- **Biodiversity & Air Pollution** – Studying the effects of urban and agricultural air pollutants on birds and insects.  
- **Agroecological impact assessment** – Exploring how conservation tillage and residue management affect biodiversity.  
- **Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazards** – Developing ecological solutions for safer airfields.  
- **Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI)** – Integrating biodiversity-friendly spaces into urban planning.
